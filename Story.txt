When graduation day came the young man's father called him into the study
The father handed him a wrapped gift and congratulated him about his graduation and his achievement
Looking disappointed the son opened the gift to find a lovely leather bound journal with the young man's name embossed on the cover
He angrily raised his voice threw down the journal and stormed out
The young man had not seen his father since graduation day 
He became successful and was wealthy like his father with a beautiful home and family
He came to realize his father was aging and it may be time to put the past behind them
